# BachRefSyntheticData
The code for synthetic data generation 
In this GIT repository the code that was used for synthetic data generation to support my research regarding privacy evaluation in a lab information system can be found.
Running the code gives 1500 instances of a request to a lab information system for a test. 
Not all these instances will go through. Some will be abandonded after step 2 to simulate a patient not showing up
